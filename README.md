=============================
A complete server-side and client-side validations library in ES6 JavaScript.

Influence
-----------------------------
Play Framework 2.x.x form validations

Usage
-----------------------------
You can validate on types like `number`, `float`, `boolean`, and `string`. If there is a type you would like to test on that we don't have, just write a `string` validation for it with the appropriate tests.
